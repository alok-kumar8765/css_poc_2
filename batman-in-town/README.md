<strong>What makes Batman compelling is really personal.</strong>

Batman is such a great fictional character that you can put him in a whole lot of different scenarios, different mediums and interpretations and he still works. You really can't break Batman, as the core ideas translate very well across animation, comics, films, games etc.
